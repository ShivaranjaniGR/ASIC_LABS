- Compare different designs
    - Full Adder using 2 Half Adders (Structural Modelling)
    - Full Adder in data flow modelling
- Compare different clock frequencies of operation.
- Compare different Corners using 180nm Technology libraries for
    - Slow corner
    - fast corner
    - Typical corner
- Report Timing, Area and Power for the comparison.
 ## Theory
 ### Power, Speed and Area :
- for 180nm, area of 2x1 nand gate - area : 9.979200;

therefore, Gate Equivalent area = Total Area/9.979200

- During synthesis, power is estimated without real switching activity, using default toggle rates. (1 toggle per cycle). Therefore, Internal and switching power are approximated based on assumed input activity. However, Leakage power is computed accurately from the standard cell library and PVT conditions.
These estimates help guide early design choices.

-Negative slack occurs when data takes too long to propagate and misses the clock deadline. Increasing the clock frequency reduces the available time per cycle, often causing more negative slack if the logic isn't optimized.

##% PVT Corner Libraries :
In ASIC flows, PVT corner libraries contain timing, power, and noise models for each standard cell under different operating conditions.

| Corner Type | Library Name              | TransistorSpeed(Process)| Voltage | Temperature | Purpose                                   |
| ----------- | ------------------------- | ----------------------- | ------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **Typical** | `typical.lib` or `tt.lib` | Nominal                 | Nominal | 25Â°C (e.g.) | **Design, synthesis, and functional sim** |
| **Slow**    | `slow.lib` or `ss.lib`    | Slower (weak process)   | Lower   | Higher temp | Worst-case **setup** timing check         |
| **Fast**    | `fast.lib` or `ff.lib`    | Faster (strong process) | Higher  | Lower temp  | Worst-case **hold** timing check          |

# INFERENCES :
- Slack decreases as operating frequency of design increases.
- leakage power is independent of clock frequency but depends on the PVT corners. Leakage power depends on PVT (Process, Voltage, Temperature) corners because faster transistors (fast corner) have lower threshold voltages and leak more, while slower transistors (slow corner) have higher threshold voltages and leak less; temperature and voltage also amplify this effect.
- Across all operating frequencies and PVT corners, the total power is more in the full adder using 2 full adders compared to Behavioural modelling.as it has more logic gates and transitions, leading to higher switching and internal power than the optimized behavioral model.
- Leakage Power is higher at fast corners and will differ between architectures depending on gate count and technology cells used.
